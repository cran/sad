Description: Implementation of the wavelet-based spatial verification method of Buschow and Friederichs "SAD: Verifying the Scale, Anisotropy and Direction of precipitation forecasts" (2020, submitted to QJRMS). Forecasts and Observations are transformed by a decimated or redundant dual-tree complex wavelet transform to analyze the spatial scale, degree of anisotropy and preferred direction in each field. These structural attributes are compared by a series of scores. An experimental algorithm for the correction of these errors is included as well.
